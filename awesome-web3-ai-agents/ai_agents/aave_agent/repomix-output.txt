Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure

def lend_crypto(amount: float, asset_address: str) -> Union[str, None]:
    """
    Lends a specific cryptocurrency (via its token address) to the AAVE lending pool.

    Technical Flow:
    1. Connects to Ethereum network
    2. Initializes smart contract interfaces
    3. Approves AAVE to spend tokens (ERC20 approve)
    4. Supplies tokens to AAVE pool
    
    Parameters:
    amount (float): The amount of cryptocurrency to lend in human-readable format (e.g., 100 USDC)
    asset_address (str): The Ethereum address of the token to be lent

    Returns:
    Union[str, None]: The transaction hash if successful, None if any step fails

    Implementation Details:
    --------------------
    1. Initial Setup and Validation:
       - Logs attempt to lend with amount and asset address
       - Checks web3 connection to ensure we're connected to Ethereum
       Why: Ensures we have proper connection before attempting any transactions

    2. Contract Setup:
       - Loads minimal ERC20 ABI for token approval
       - Initializes both AAVE lending pool and token contracts
       Why: Need interfaces to interact with both the token and AAVE contracts

    3. Account Setup:
       - Creates account from private key
       - Gets current nonce (transaction count)
       - Retrieves current gas price
       Why: Required for transaction signing and gas estimation

    4. Amount Conversion:
       - Converts human-readable amount to token decimals
       Why: Smart contracts work with raw numbers, not decimals

    5. Token Approval:
       - Builds approval transaction with EIP-1559 parameters
       - Signs and sends approval transaction
       - Waits for approval confirmation
       Why: ERC20 tokens require explicit approval before third-party contracts can move them

    6. Supply to AAVE:
       - Builds supply transaction with EIP-1559 parameters
       - Signs and sends supply transaction
       - Waits for supply confirmation
       Why: Actually supplies the tokens to AAVE's lending pool

    Error Handling:
    - Separate try-catch blocks for approval and supply steps
    - Detailed logging of transaction states and errors
    - Transaction receipt validation
    Why: Provides clear error messages and transaction status for debugging

    Gas and Transaction Parameters:
    - Uses EIP-1559 transaction type (type 2)
    - Calculates maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas
    - Sets appropriate gas limits for each operation
    Why: Ensures reliable transaction processing with optimal gas costs

def borrow_crypto(amount: float, asset_address: str, interest_rate_mode: int = 2) -> Union[str, None]:
    """
    Borrow cryptocurrency from the AAVE lending pool.

    Technical Flow:
    1. Connects to Ethereum network
    2. Initializes AAVE lending pool interface
    3. Executes borrow transaction
    4. Waits for confirmation
    
    Parameters:
    amount (float): The amount of cryptocurrency to borrow in human-readable format (e.g., 100 USDC)
    asset_address (str): The Ethereum address of the token to be borrowed
    interest_rate_mode (int): Interest rate type (2 for variable). Defaults to 2 (variable) since stable rate is deprecated in AAVE V3.

    Returns:
    Union[str, None]: The transaction hash if successful, None if any step fails

    Interest Rate Modes:
    - Mode 1 (Stable): Fixed interest rate that can change under specific conditions
    - Mode 2 (Variable): Interest rate that varies based on market conditions
    Why: Stable rates provide predictability but might be higher, variable rates fluctuate but could be lower

    Implementation Details:
    --------------------
    1. Initial Setup and Validation:
       - Logs attempt to borrow with amount and asset address
       - Checks web3 connection to ensure we're connected to Ethereum
       Why: Ensures we have proper connection before attempting any transactions

    2. Contract Setup:
       - Initializes AAVE lending pool interface
       Why: Need interface to interact with AAVE's borrowing functionality

    3. Account Setup:
       - Creates account from private key
       - Gets current nonce (transaction count)
       - Retrieves current gas price
       Why: Required for transaction signing and gas estimation

    4. Amount Conversion:
       - Converts human-readable amount to token decimals
       Why: Smart contracts work with raw numbers, not decimals

    5. Borrow from AAVE:
       - Builds borrow transaction with EIP-1559 parameters
       - Signs and sends borrow transaction
       - Waits for confirmation
       Why: Actually borrows the tokens from AAVE's lending pool

    Error Handling:
    - Detailed logging of transaction states and errors
    - Transaction receipt validation
    Why: Provides clear error messages and transaction status for debugging

    Gas and Transaction Parameters:
    - Uses EIP-1559 transaction type (type 2)
    - Calculates maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas
    - Sets appropriate gas limits
    Why: Ensures reliable transaction processing with optimal gas costs
